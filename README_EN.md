### Requirements
Before use, ensure that the database user from WorldDatabaseInfo (default acore) also has access to the new customs schema:

```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON customs.* TO 'acore'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

### ⚠️ Warning – Reserved IDs
The module modifies the test token in item_template via world/base/token_apply.sql (optional):
Do not import world/backup/token_revert.sql if you don’t want to restore the original test token.
The module uses its own customs database and tables for writing and reading data which it then utilizes.
